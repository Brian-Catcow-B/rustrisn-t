Unreleased.
Added a list of used KeyCode's stored in the inputconfig menu that notifies the user if they try to reuse a KeyCode and ignores the input.
Escape quits out of creating a keyboard layout.
G sets a player to be controlled by a gamepad.
Users can setup their own gamepad layouts by adding their SDL2 Gamepad string to /resources/gamecontrollerdb.txt.
Gamepads auto-map to the first player that doesn't have a GamepadId mapping to it for easy setup.
